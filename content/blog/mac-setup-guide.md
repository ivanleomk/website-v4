# Setting Up My MacBook for ML Development: A Living Guide

This is a living document that I'll be updating over the next few weeks as I continue setting up and optimizing my new MacBook development environment. While I followed most of Eugene Yan's excellent [minimal setup guide](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/mac-setup/), I made some specific choices based on my workflow needs.

## Core Development Setup

I kept things minimal for my general development environment, following most of Eugene's recommendations but focusing on just the essentials:

<!-- more -->

```bash
# Core development tools I use daily
brew install git htop warp uv node bun gh
```

Why these specific choices? They form the backbone of my development workflow without adding unnecessary complexity.

### Direnv

I have a lot of different projects that I work on which I'd like to use different environment variables for. I've been using direnv to manage this.

```bash
brew install direnv
```

The main value add here seems to be that you can have a `.envrc` file in each project directory that can override the global environment variables that you set up in your `.zshrc` file itself. This is really useful for switching between different projects when they require different environment variables. There are really two downsides

1. You need to approve direnv to load the `.envrc` file in each directory every single time you open a new terminal session.
2. You can't seem to selectively unset environment variables in the global `.zshrc` file that you set in the `.envrc` file in each directory and only have a subset of the vars

Eg. if you had FOO_1, FOO_2, BAR_1 in your global `.zshrc` file, you can't seem to get just FOO_1 in your new subdirectory shell without manually unsetting the other two in the `.envrc` file. I'd love to know if there's a better way to do this

### Httpie

I've started using httpie over curl because it's just so much nicer to use. You can download them from [here](https://httpie.io/download)

### Mkdocs Specific

Since I use mkdocs for my blog and for instructor's documentation, I had to configure `Cairo` support for it. To do so, i installed the required deps as they mentioned in the mkdocs documentation.

```bash
brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib
```

I then configured some local paths

```bash
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
```

!!! note

    Make sure to add this to your specific shell in order for this to work

And that was good enough for me to get my mkdocs builds running locally.

## Local LLMs with Jan

One significant deviation from Eugene's guide was choosing Jan instead of the Ollama + OpenWebUI combination. Jan has become my go-to tool for playing with local LLMs because:

1. **Unified Interface**: Instead of juggling multiple terminal processes, Jan provides a single, cohesive environment
2. **Easy Setup**: Getting started is as simple as downloading their binary from their website itself
3. **Local-First Approach**: Perfect for developing and testing LLM applications without relying on external services
4. **Resource Management**: Better control over model loading and management compared to running separate services

## Research and Documentation

For research and documentation, I'm excited about a few specific tools:

### Zotero

I'm particularly looking forward to using Zotero for paper reading and annotation. As I'm diving deeper into ML research, having a solid system for managing academic papers is crucial. Zotero's features that really appealed to me:

- Built-in PDF reader with good markup tools
- Seamless iPad sync for reading on the go
- Better organization than my previous Google Drive setup

### Obsidian + Notion

I'm using a combination of both:

- **Obsidian**: Personal knowledge management and note-taking
- **Notion**: Company-wide documentation and collaboration

This dual setup lets me maintain detailed personal notes while staying integrated with my team's documentation workflow.

### Wisprflow

This is a new dictation tool that essentially allows me to dictate. And it runs much faster than the existing one I'm using which is SuperWhisper. So I'm quite excited to see how it's going to turn out as I experiment and learn a bit more about the tool.

## Upcoming Explorations

I'm planning to explore and document my experience with:

- Setting up efficient paper reading workflows in Zotero
- Integrating Jan with my development process
- Optimizing the Obsidian-Notion workflow to avoid duplicate effort
