Rules & Design Principles

1. Use playwright to take an image, scroll down to the exact portion of the page using the id of your component and verify how your frontend changes look. Prefer using playwright mcp functions when possible.
2. Make sure to create reusable components where possible
3. There is already a dev server running at 3000
4. Use Bun please to install components

Design Philosophy:

- Built on Swiss design principles with a black and white color palette
- Clean and minimal style that lets content take center stage
- Relaxed, approachable tone in content and interactions
- Strong visual hierarchy through typography and spacing
- Focus on readability and user experience
